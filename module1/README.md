## Introduction to Programming Basics


# Section 1: Introduction to Programming Concepts (Variables, Data Types, and Operators)

- Simple Calculator: Create a program that takes two numbers as input from the user (using prompts or similar input mechanisms), performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and displays the results. Handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero, nonnumeric input)


# Section 2: Understanding Functions and Their Role in Code Organization

- Temperature Conversion Function: Create a function thatconverts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Allow the user to specify the input scale and temperature. The function should return the converted temperature.


# Section 3: Basic Control Structures (Conditionals and Loops)
Grade Calculator: Build a program that takes student scores as input and calculates their letter grade based on a grading scale (e.g., A, B, C, D, F). Allow the program to handle multiple student scores.


# Section 4: Introduction to Error Handling and Debugging
Robust Calculator: Improve the simple calculator from Section 1 to handle more error conditions (e.g., invalid input, division by zero) using try...catch (JavaScript) or equivalent error handling mechanisms. Provide informative error messages
