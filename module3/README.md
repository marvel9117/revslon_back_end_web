# Introduction to Backend Development with JavaScript and Node.js


## Section 1: Overview of the Client-Server Model and HTTP
- HTTP Request Client: Build a small program (using Node.js) that makes an HTTP GET request to a public API (e.g., a weather API) and displays the response

# Section 2: Introduction to Node.js for Backend
- Basic REST API (single endpoint): Create a simple REST API endpoint that returns a JSON object (e.g., a list of names) when a GET request is made to a specific URL

# Section 3: Understanding and Using Asynchronous JavaScript(Callbacks, Promises)
- API Data Fetching: Fetch data from a public API asynchronously (e.g., a weather API, a news API). Handle potential errors during the request and display the fetched data
